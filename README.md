Let's learn to use GitHub!

Hey there, I'm Nate. I know you are probably not reading this, but in case you are, I am learning to use GitHub; Isn't that cool. I found a project that I want to contribute to, but before I attempt to make any crazy changes to it, I want to make sure that I know what the heck I am doing here. Wouldn't it be horribly embarassing if I made a mistake and ruined everyones hard work. That is why I am doing this tutorial; I want to gain knowledge. You know the old saying, "Knowledge is half the battle. GI-JOE!"
